This includes understanding the most popular brands, the average quantity purchased, and spending habits across different markets. Here are some specific analyses we can perform:\n\nCalculate the total quantity and spending for each brand.\nFind the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase.\nCompare the total spending across different markets.\n\nI’ll begin with these analyses and create visualizations to help us understand the data better. Let’s start by calculating the total quantity and spending for each brand.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Reading the CSV file\nbeer_data = pd.read_csv(\"https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv\")\n\n# Setting up the visualisation settings\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n# Calculate total quantity and spending for each brand\nbrand_summary = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({'quantity':'sum', 'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total quantity and spending\nbrand_summary_sorted_quantity = brand_summary.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\nbrand_summary_sorted_spent = brand_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n\n# Plotting total quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=brand_summary_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Total Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting total spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=brand_summary_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar charts above display the total quantity of beer purchased and the total spending by brand. From the looks of it, certain brands dominate in terms of quantity sold and total spending, indicating their popularity.\nNow, let’s calculate the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase. For this, we’ll consider each row in the dataset as a separate purchase and compute the averages accordingly.\n\n# Calculate average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase\naverage_purchase = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({\n    'quantity': 'mean', \n    'dollar_spent': 'mean'\n}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by average quantity and average spending\naverage_purchase_sorted_quantity = average_purchase.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\naverage_purchase_sorted_spent = average_purchase.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting average quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting average spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations above depict the average quantity of beer purchased per brand and the average spending per brand. This shows which brands tend to be bought in larger quantities on average and which brands tend to have higher spending per purchase, which could be indicative of their price point or the purchase of premium products.\nNext, we’ll look at the total spending across different markets to see if there are any notable differences in spending habits geographically. To do this, we’ll sum up the spending in each market and visualize it.\n\n# Calculate total spending in each market\nmarket_spending_summary = beer_data.groupby('market').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nmarket_spending_summary_sorted = market_spending_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending in each market\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='market', data=market_spending_summary_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Market')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Market')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the total spending on beer by market, showcasing the differences in spending habits across various regions. Some markets have significantly higher spending, which could be due to a variety of factors including market size, consumer preferences, or economic factors.\nNow, let’s move on to the second analysis:"

    "text": "Demographic Analysis\nWe will examine which demographics are buying what kind of beer and whether spending habits vary by demographics such as age, employment, and race. For this, we could look at:\n\nSpending by age group\nSpending by employment status\nSpending by race\n\nI’ll start by analyzing spending by age group.\n\n# Calculate total spending by age group\nage_group_spending = beer_data.groupby('age').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nage_group_spending_sorted = age_group_spending.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending by age group\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='age', data=age_group_spending_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Age Group')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Age Group')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart demonstrates the total spending on beer segmented by age group, highlighting which age groups spend the most on beer. It appears that certain age groups are more dominant in beer spending, which may align with the purchasing power or preferences of those groups.\nNext, we will examine spending by employment status.\n\n# Calculate total spending by employment status\nemployment_spending = beer_data.groupby('employment').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nemployment_spending_sorted = employment_spending.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending by employment status\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='employment', data=employment_spending_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Employment Status')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Employment Status')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization shows the total spending on beer by employment status. We can see that certain employment groups, such as full-time workers, are spending more on beer, which might be related to their disposable income.\nFinally, let’s look at spending by race to complete the demographic analysis.\n\n# Calculate total spending by race\nrace_spending = beer_data.groupby('race').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nrace_spending_sorted = race_spending.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending by race\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='race', data=race_spending_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Race')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Race')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart above indicates the total spending on beer broken down by race, highlighting which racial groups account for the most beer spending within the dataset. This could reflect both the demographics of the regions where the data was collected and cultural preferences regarding beer.\nNow, let’s proceed to the third analysis:"

This gives us a sense of whether there’s a relationship between the price and the quantity purchased. The x-axis labels are quite compressed due to the number of brands, but we can still observe trends such as whether lower-priced beers tend to be purchased in larger quantities.\nLastly, let’s move to the fourth analysis:"

A positive value indicates that, on average, more beer is purchased when there is a promotion compared to when there isn’t. Some brands appear to be significantly more influenced by promotions, with customers buying more when the products are on sale or promotion.\nThis comprehensive analysis has provided insights into purchase patterns, demographic preferences, price sensitivity, and the impact of promotions on beer purchases."

    "text": "Introduction: This project matters because it affected the rate at which people are contracting and healing from the COVID 19 virus at a daily rate. There is a greater amount of people who are recovering compared to the people who are dying.\nData Summary: Our data visualization entails how both death and recovered are increasing at an exponential rate. This provides the assumption that while many may be dying there are more people recovering. In the real world this provides hope for those who are suffering from the virus..\nThis is our R set up. In order to demo certain data we need to go into our library and import the packages we will need order to proceed with this project. The example our case is demonstrated below.\nWe need to assign a name to the data frame that we will be using and copy the path name of the github repository that we will be using in this project. Jocelyn’s repository is exemplified below.\nday_wise &lt;- read_csv('https://jem10126.github.io/day_wise.csv')\nnvars &lt;- format(round(ncol(day_wise), 0), \n                nsmall=0, \n                big.mark=\",\") \nnobs &lt;- format(round(nrow(day_wise), 0), \n                nsmall=0, \n                big.mark=\",\")\nHere is the paged table using rmarkdown::paged_table() with the results = 'asis' chunk option.\nrmarkdown::paged_table(day_wise)\nData Visualization: We created a ggplot figure in order for us to see exactly how the relationship between amount of deaths and recoveries intertwinds with one another. My group and I decided that a line plot would be of best fit because line plots are useful to track changes over short and long periods of time.\nday_wise %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = log(Deaths), \n             y = log(Recovered))) + \n  geom_point(alpha = .1, color = 'purple') +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = 'top')\nData Transformation: We used the group by function here in order to group rows that have the same values into summary rows, which then allows us to use the function summary, in order to summarize the statistics provided.\nday_wise &lt;- day_wise %&gt;% \n  group_by(Deaths, Recovered) %&gt;% \n  summarise(Recovered_tot = sum(Recovered, na.rm = T),\n            Deaths_mean = round(mean(Deaths, na.rm = T), 2),\n            .groups = \"drop\")"
